## Introduction
- Purchasing a real estate for personal homeownership, investment purposes, or commercial ventures is a significant financial decision, because real estate is uncertain:
    - Lack of predictive information regarding future expectations for selling or buying a home (Zha et al., 2022)
    - Need of large sums of money for purchasing real estate (Chen & Wang, 2023)
    - Similar risk level as equity investment in the long run, in addition to poorer liquidity attribute (MacKinnon & Al Zaman, 2009)
- However, the expectation of price appreciation is still an allure to many (N. Ragapriya et al., 2023)
- Moreover, real estate market is imperative for socioeconomic stability (Zhan et al., 2023)

## Problem Statement
More studies are needed in this domain, because of three main issues:
- **Issue #1**: House price indices provides insufficient information, they are not predictive of future market activity and do not provide enough information on the market conditions in the near future (Zha et al., 2022)
- **Issue #2**: Real estate prices are influenced by a variety of factors:
difficult to correctly quantify the impact of each component
no agreement on the ranking of factors based on the magnitude of their impact on real estate prices (Iliychovski et al., 2022)
- As a result, the ability to accurately estimate real estate values becomes critical (Munusamy et al., 2015)
- **Issue #3**: Shortage of similar studies for Malaysian real estate market, despite being one of the most important sector:
At least 60% of Malaysia’s growth was contributed from the transaction volume of the residential real estate from 1990 to 2007 (Yahya et al., 2021)
Only two (2) studies on Malaysia (Ayyasamy et al., 2022; Sa’at et al., 2021), compared to China (5)
- Therefore, this work aims to fill the major gap in existing research in the Malaysian real estate scene

## Research Objectives
1. To develop and evaluate time series and machine learning models to forecast the future price of the real estate
2. To develop and deploy a data product which calculates the total returns of the real estate, considering the future price and costs incurred throughout the ownership period of the asset.

## Research Scope
2. Geographical region of interest: Klang Valley (Kuala Lumpur and Selangor)
Type of real estate of interest: Residential
1. Source of data of interest: Transacted property prices (stamp duty paid) recorded by the Ministry of Finance’s Valuation and Property Service Department (or *Jabatan Penilaian dan Perkhidmatan Harta*, JPPH) and provided by Brickz.my
3. Variables / attributes of interest: Publicly available i.e. Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), Central Bank of Malaysia (or *Bank Negara Malaysia*, BNM) and Ministry of Finance (MOF)

## Contribution
1. Developed models will provide insights to whether machine learning methods are better than classical time series methods at forecasting real estate prices
2. Developed data product will provide stakeholders an extra point of consideration in the decision making of purchasing the real estate
3. Expands the existing research on price forecasting of real estate in Malaysia

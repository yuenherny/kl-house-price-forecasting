## What does the current literature say about the impact of economic indicators on house price?
Several existing literature discovered that economical climate has impact on house price. The following list of factors were compiled by ChatGPT 3.5 with information extracted from the literature review table, cross-checked with each references:
- **Interest Rate**: Higher interest rates increases the cost of mortgage (Abidoye et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2021).
- **Unemployment Rate**: Higher employment rate increases the number of participants of housing market (Abidoye et al., 2019).
- **Household or Personal Income**: Income affect individual ability to afford housing mortgage (Iliychovski et al., 2022; Abidoye et al., 2019).
- **Credit Availability**: The ease of accessing credit and mortgages from banks (Iliychovski et al., 2022; Al-Marwani, 2015).
- **Money Supply**: Total amount of money circulating in the economy (Zhan et al., 2023; Li et al., 2020).
- **Regulation**: Government policies including fiscal/monetary, land and tax policies (Yu, 2022) and foreign reserves (Lee et al., 2021).
- **Household Size**: Miniaturisation of household (smaller household size) increases demand for residential units (Mohamed et al., 2023; Yu, 2022; Abidoye et al., 2019).
- **Population Growth**: Higher population increases demand for housing (Abidoye et al., 2019).
- **Consumer Psychological Demand**: Higher cultural level of consumers contribute to higher quality of life and therefore real estate demand (Yu, 2022).
- **Environmental Factors**: Natural environmental conditions like landscapes, municipal infrastructure (transportation facilities, post and telecommunications facilities, and water supply and drainage facilities) and water supply and drainage facilities, public building supporting facilities conditions (Yu, 2022; Lee et al, 2021).
- **Social Factors**: Politics, social security, urbanization development level (Yu, 2022) and crime rate (Lee et al., 2021; Yu, 2022).
